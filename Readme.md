![Query-R-Bajaj Logo](assets/logo.svg)

Small utility repository containing `process.py` — a script for (brief description: data processing / querying tasks). This README explains the project's purpose, setup, and basic usage so you can get started quickly.

## Contents

- `process.py` — main script for the project's processing/querying logic.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.

## Quick summary

This project contains a compact Python script for performing a focused data processing/query task. It's intended to be lightweight and easy to run locally.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (recommended)
- pip

All Python dependencies (if any) are listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this repository to your machine.
2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

	- On Windows PowerShell:

	  ```powershell
	  python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
	  ```

3. Install dependencies:

	```powershell
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	```

## Usage

Run the main script with Python. Example (PowerShell):

```powershell
python process.py
```

If `process.py` accepts command-line arguments or configuration files, refer to the top of the script for usage notes or run it with `-h`/`--help` if implemented.

## Development notes

- Keep dependencies minimal — `requirements.txt` lists any third-party packages used.
- If you modify `process.py`, consider adding a small example or unit tests that demonstrate expected inputs/outputs.

## Troubleshooting

- If you see import errors, ensure you installed the requirements and are using the correct Python interpreter/virtual environment.
- For permission issues on Windows when creating a venv, run PowerShell as Administrator or choose a different folder.

## Contributing

Small changes are welcome. For larger contributions, open an issue describing the change first. Include tests or example usage when relevant.

## License

This repository is provided without an explicit license. If you want to permit reuse, add a license file (for example, `LICENSE` with the MIT license).

Notes
- If you'd like, I can improve this README by reading `process.py` and adding concrete usage examples and the exact dependency list. Would you like me to do that next?
